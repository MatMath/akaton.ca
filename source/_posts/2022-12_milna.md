<h2>Milna</h2>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<p>Our home for the winter this year is Milna. The village has two cafes and two restaurants, a beach and riva for 7km walks and really great mountains for hiking. There is a ferry daily to Split for commuting 9-5. </p>

<p>Milna is warmer than Split by several degrees, and less rain too! Compared to last winter in Split I can sit outside durring daylight hours without feeling cold. The sun sets early, around 16h30 so I often have to bundle up for some of my later meetings.</p>

<p>Ironically, our marina is in the shadow of a hill so we don\'t get good signal on the boat. This makes it one of the most difficult places to work at night so I switched to working Dublin hours while I`m here.</p>

<p>On Sundays I go to have a coffee and then to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/CZWAsj82QANquJWp9\" target=\"_blank\">Crkva Gospa od Blagovijesti</a> for mass. I found a <a href=\"https://medjugorje.info/medjugorje/index.php/hr/duhovni-program/molitve/misa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">transcript of mass</a> that I can learn from. I have been learning Croatian on <a href=\"https://a1.ffzg.unizg.hr/\">https://a1.ffzg.unizg.hr/</a> and using <a href=\"https://www.lingsync.org/{{AUTHOR_CESINE}}/croatian\">https://www.lingsync.org/{{AUTHOR_CESINE}}/croatian</a> to enter new phrases.</p>
