<div><strong>Experience:</strong> 40NM (Nautical Miles) / 12h sailling (Did a sail class)</div>
<h2>Split</h2>

<p>This winter I am in Split, boat hunting. I found several coffee shops and restaurants to work. At my appartment I have a heater and a washing machine, but it is rarely dry enough for more than 1 day to dry my clothes. </p>

<p>Last week we had 39 knot wind on land due to the catabatic effect of the mountains. Its cold at night (4 degrees) and I'm impressed with the weather here. For three days we might have wind from the south (jugo) and heavy rain, and then cold clear days with wind from the north (bora). I have visited all the boat yards around Split, Trogir, Rogoznica and Rovinj. I contacted a few Croatian language schools and teachers to get private lessons in nautical terminology but so far I find my best profs of Damatian Croatian are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/@prakticniribolov5459" target="_blank">Praktični ribolov</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/@CovikSMora" target="_blank">Čovik S Mora.</a> </p>
