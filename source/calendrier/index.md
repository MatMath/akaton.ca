<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>
<strong>What should we bring?<br>
</strong>Bring a long sleeve sunshirt, sunglasses, a hat and hiking shoes. Bring very little, we have everything you might need.</p>

<p>
<strong>When can we visit?</strong>
<br>Our boat is currently at a marina until April 30. This is a great time to visit us because you can walk off the boat and into the village. This summer we will be in Croatia or Montenegro. The spring in Milna starts much earlier than in Montreal. The air temperature is comfortable to sit outside (above 16 degrees) from April until November. Water temperature is swimmable (above 18 degrees) from May until December. In the spring the water is not very warm, similar to a lake in Quebec in June, we have 3 shortie wetsuits you can use. </p>

<p>
<strong>How long should we visit?</strong>
<br>We are always happy to have our friends and family visit us. We recommend visiting for two weeks or longer so that you have at least three days to do nothing but get adjusted to the timezone. We recommend arriving and departing on weekdays if possible since there are more frequent ferries and busses so it is easier to arrive at the boat/airport. Sundays are a day of rest in Europe, don't expect to travel or go to stores on Sundays. We have three cabins, we can sleep 4 adults and 3 kids comfortably. We have found that Jet lag will make you dehydrated, drowsy and nauseous so we won't plan to do activities when you arrive. We have paddleboards, snorkels, fishing rods, a spear gun, and many other activities you can do when you visit. If you are able to work remotely and can visit for longer, we can anchor near a village where we can go to cafes and explore life on land as well.</p>

<p>
<strong>Do you need boatsitters in May or July?<br>
</strong>Yes! This year Croatia joined the Schengen zone, which we didn't expect to happen. If we do not get a visa to stay longer in Croatia, we might need boat sitters to help watch the boat while we leave the Schengen area to buy more time in the Schengen time limits. As Canadians, we can only be in Croatia or Greece for a total of 90 days out of 180 days. So if you are free to boatsit this spring/summer, let us know!</p>

<p>
<strong>Can I boatsit if I don't know how to drive a boat?<br>
</strong>Yes! We will anchor the boat somewhere it is protected. We will show you how to drive the boat and let you practice lifting the anchor and setting the anchor, but you won't need to move it if you don't know how. You can get around and go fishing using the digny (our "car" that has a small 6hp outboard engine).</p>

<p>
<strong>What if I have never lived on a boat?<br>
</strong>Think of boat living as camping. We have limited water, electricity, propane and internet. You can watch The O'Kelly's video about being a guest on a boat; it has lots of tips and explanations of why some habits are different when visiting a boat vs visiting a house.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

<p>We LOVE sharing the cruising lifestyle with guests and crew aboard Clarity. But for folks who’ve never lived on a boat before, there’s some adjusting required. Limited water and power, food and internet are all issues visitors need to be aware of....important toilet concerns as well. We got a chuckle out of making this one! Enjoy! - The O'Kelly's<br>
